# Troubleshooting Next.js Error

## üö® Problem
Getting error: "Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory"

## üîç Root Cause
Your system is trying to run this as a Next.js application, but this is a **React.js** application using Create React App.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

### **Method 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
Run the fix script:
\`\`\`bash
chmod +x fix-nextjs-error.sh
./fix-nextjs-error.sh
\`\`\`

### **Method 2: Manual Fix**

1. **Remove Next.js files:**
   \`\`\`bash
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf next.config.js
   rm -rf next.config.mjs
   \`\`\`

2. **Clean and reinstall:**
   \`\`\`bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Verify package.json:**
   Make sure your scripts section has:
   \`\`\`json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "start": "react-scripts start",
       "build": "react-scripts build",
       "test": "react-scripts test",
       "eject": "react-scripts eject"
     }
   }
   \`\`\`

### **Method 3: Fresh Start**

If the above doesn't work, create a fresh React app:

\`\`\`bash
# Create new React app
npx create-react-app roomoree-frontend-new
cd roomoree-frontend-new

# Copy your source files
cp -r ../roomoree-frontend/src/* ./src/
cp ../roomoree-frontend/.env ./
cp ../roomoree-frontend/public/* ./public/

# Install additional dependencies
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-router-dom axios react-hook-form react-hot-toast lucide-react

# Start the app
npm start
\`\`\`

## ‚úÖ Verification

After fixing, you should see:
\`\`\`bash
npm start
# Should show:
# "webpack compiled successfully"
# "Local: http://localhost:3000"
\`\`\`

## üîç How to Identify the Issue

### **React.js App (Correct):**
- Uses `react-scripts`
- Has `src/` folder with `index.js`
- Package.json has `"start": "react-scripts start"`
- No `.next` folder

### **Next.js App (Wrong for this project):**
- Uses `next`
- Has `pages/` or `app/` folder
- Package.json has `"start": "next start"`
- Has `.next` folder after build

## üöÄ After Fix

Once fixed, you can:
1. Run `npm start` successfully
2. Access your app at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Use the integration test page

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting errors:

1. **Check your current directory:**
   \`\`\`bash
   pwd
   ls -la
   \`\`\`

2. **Check package.json:**
   \`\`\`bash
   cat package.json | grep -A 10 "scripts"
   \`\`\`

3. **Check for conflicting files:**
   \`\`\`bash
   ls -la | grep next
   \`\`\`

4. **Start fresh:**
   Create a new React app and copy your files over.

## üí° Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
- Always use `npx create-react-app` for React projects
- Don't mix Next.js and React.js files
- Keep your `package.json` scripts consistent
- Use the correct project structure for each framework
